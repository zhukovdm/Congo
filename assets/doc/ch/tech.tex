\section{.NET technology coverage}

Game engine is supposed to be a computationaly intensive application,
therefore it is reasonable to parallel evaluation once board is issued to the
certain heuristic. The application will use pure threads or tasks to obtain
the next move. To achieve better results it is important to avoid repeated
evaluation of the already achieved boards. It is planned to implement data
structure with simultaneous access for storing temporary results.

\vspace{0.5em}

The immediate states of the game (board with pieces and players) are supposed
to be immutable for easier evaluation. Immutable data structures
(\textsf{ImmutableArray}\textless \textsf{T}\textgreater, etc.) will certainly
be used.

\vspace{0.5em}

The application will occasionally use LinqToObjects extensions to iterate
over data structures in less computationaly intensive cases.

It is planned to apply other technologies, such as delegates and lambda
functions. However, the context or use cases are not clear at the moment.
Therefore, I don't want to promise something I will not use at all.
