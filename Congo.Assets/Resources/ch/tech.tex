Game engine is supposed to be a computationally intensive application,
therefore expensive abstractions are generally avoided.

Current implementation of the Negamax algorithm takes incoming game and
divides moves equally between tasks executed in the thread pool. Such
implementation is possible due to game immutability. It is not necessary
to perform do/undo operations. The best result is chosen from the task
results.

A hash table instance is accessed by several threads concurrently. Locking
policy is implemented for all read/write cell operations.

The immediate state of the game (board with pieces and players) are completely
immutable. Immutable data structures are used everywhere.

Delegates and lambda functions are heavily used in less intensive project parts,
such as leap generation or user command verification.

There is an example of a LINQ query, the board implements custom
IParametrizedEnumerable generic interface and BitScanEnumerator is an
implementation of custom IParametrizedEnumerator generic interface.
