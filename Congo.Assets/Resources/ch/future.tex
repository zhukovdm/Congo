\section{Future development}

The following extensions are considered essential for further project
development and will be implemented later. Extensions are ordered based
on a relevancy.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Migration from \textsf{.NET Framework} to \textsf{.NET Core} stack.
      However, pros and cons are not clear.
\item \textsf{Congo.Server} project will implement server part of a network
      stack. Client part will be integrated into the existing \textsf{Congo.CLI}
      project and non-existing \textsf{Congo.WFA/WPF} project, as client should
      somehow interact with the user.
\item Implementation of an advanced evaluation function and advanced algorithms for
      traversing game tree. This could vary based on current knowledge. Some
      of the ideas are mentioned in the presentation.
\item Game integration with \textsf{SQL} database.
\item \textsf{Congo.WFA/WPF} graphical user interface.
\item Web application.
\end{enumerate}
